# Weather Dashboard
## Description
I have built a weather dashboard application to find the current weather conditions & 5-day forecast based on the user input.

## Usage
This application is used to check a location's weather conditions given the user's input. A user can type their desired city in the search bar, and once they've clicked submit, they will be able to see a list of information about the current weather for that location.

## Resources
* OpenWeather API - https://openweathermap.org/forecast5
